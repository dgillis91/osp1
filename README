# osp1

## To Do
- Very obviously, implement all the code
- Add books to references
- Add error handling to the options. That is, validate combinations & params.
- Add the additional options
- Formalize references
- Add error handling in the parse function for atoi. Possibly move to
 using a method that can detect errors. Need to see if available on hoare.
- Add rules to makefile for building tests
- Make a struct that HAS-A stat_t. This will make it possible to get all of
 the data back for printing, because stat doesn't have file name.
- After ^, update the queue to use this struct. 

## Notes:
- I don't really need to pass around a reference to the options struct. I could pass
 it back by value. It's not that much data, and only one should be created.
- We can get all of the details from the stat commands.
