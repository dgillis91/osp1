# osp1

## Build
In the project directory, change to the folder `src` and execute:

```
make dt
```

The executable will move to a folder called `bin` in the project directory.

## Run
Format as specified in the project documentation:

```
dt [-h] [-I n] [-L -d -g -i -p -s -t -u | -l] [dirname]
```

For:

-h Print a help message and exit.
-I n Change indentation to n spaces for each level.
-L Follow symbolic links, if any. Default will be to not follow symbolic links. t Print information on file type.
-p Print permission bits as rwxrwxrwx.
-i Print the number of links to file in inode table.
-u Print the uid associated with the file.
-g Print the gid associated with the file.
-s Print the size of file in bytes. If the size is larger than 1K, indicate the size in KB with a suffix K; if the 
size is larger than 1M, indicate the size in MB with a suffix M; if the size is larger than 1G, indicate the size in GB with a suffix G.
-l This option will be used to print information on the file as if the options tpiugs are all specified.

## To Do
- Refactor as necessary. 

## Notes:
- There is one known issue with the output. Currently, any base level directory name messes up the output.
